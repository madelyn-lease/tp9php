      <li>Preheat oven to <span class="bold">350 degrees F</span> (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 10x15-inch baking pan with vegetable shortening.</li>
      <li>Combine yellow cake mix, eggs, water, vegetable oil, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract in a large mixing bowl.</li>
      <li>Beat with electric mixer until very smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.</li>
      <li>Scrape batter into the prepared baking pan. Smooth the top of the batter, shake pan, and tap lightly on counter 2 or 3 times to eliminate air bubbles.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean, about 22 minutes.</li>
      <li>Let cake cool in the pan at least 30 minutes. Poke holes all over the cake with a bamboo skewer or the handle of a wooden spoon.</li>
      <li>Combine evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and half-and-half in a large bowl; slowly pour milk syrup all over the cake.</li>
      <li>Syrup will soak into cake. Wrap cake with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 3 hours (or preferably overnight).</li>
      <li>Whip cream with sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer until cream is fluffy; spoon whipped cream over cake.</li>
